Python project to control an X-Y stage from a raspberry pi computer. 

The raspberry Pi will use the stepper driver circuit in https://github.com/westerlymerlin/UCL-Helium-Line-Documentation to control the 24v bipolar steppers. 

Controls X-Y stage via bipolar stepper motors and an ADC controller to read positional information. 

The application runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 computer and is controlled via a REST API
